    <string name="manualDACalc1">Enter <b>Station pressure</b> and <b>Temperature</b>. The field <b>Elevation</b> is optional. The application will calculate pressure altitude and 3
        results of density altitude (for comparison). All implemented equations are described on Wikipedia pages: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_altitude and
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_altitude. Choose corresponding units G.State.options. You can also select ft or m for output units.</string>

    <string name="manualDACalc2">The first density altitude equation is calculated from the atmospheric pressure and the outside air temperature (assuming dry air).</string>

    <string name="manualDACalc3">The second equation is implementation of The National Weather Service formula. NWS is an agency of the United States federal government that is tasked with providing
        weather related information.</string>

    <string name="manualDACalc4">The final equation is the approximate formula for calculating density altitude based on pressure altitude.</string>
